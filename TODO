* Drop the slot "state", it is not really useful.

* Can we drop the slot "batch"? It mostly seems to blow the object
  structure and complicate the code. Perhaps batches are best dealt
  with at the user level, because they can stratify the data in
  infinitely many complicated ways.

* The writeReport should strongly encourage users to provide the
  history of the object being shown in the form of the R script with
  which they created it.
